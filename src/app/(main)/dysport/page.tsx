              Dysport and Botox are both popular injectable treatments designed
              to smooth wrinkles and fine lines by temporarily relaxing targeted
              facial muscles. While they work in similar ways, there are subtle
              differences that may make one more suitable for your unique goals.
              Dysport tends to spread more easily, making it an excellent choice
              for larger treatment areas like the forehead, while Botox offers
              precise targeting for smaller, more defined lines. The right
              option depends on your skin concerns, desired results, and how
              your body responds to each formula. At Esteves Aesthetics, our
              experienced team will guide you through the decision process,
              ensuring you receive a treatment plan that delivers the most
              natural, rejuvenating results possible.

                Botox is an excellent option for individuals looking to reduce
                the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles caused by repetitive
                facial expressions, such as frowning, squinting, or smiling.
                Ideal candidates are generally healthy adults who wish to
                achieve a smoother, more refreshed look without surgery or
                extensive downtime. It is particularly effective for treating
                crowâ€™s feet, forehead lines, and frown lines between the brows.
                Botox may also be suitable for those seeking to prevent the
                early signs of aging before wrinkles become deeply set. However,
                individuals who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or have certain
                neurological conditions should avoid Botox.

            description="Before receiving Botox, a thorough consultation is essential to ensure the treatment is safe, effective, and tailored to your needs. During your appointment, your provider will discuss your aesthetic goals, review your medical history, and assess your facial anatomy to determine the best injection sites and dosage for optimal results. This is also the time to address any questions or concerns you may have about the procedure, recovery, and expected outcomes. In preparation for Botox, you may be advised to avoid certain medications or supplements that can increase bruising such as aspirin, ibuprofen, vitamin E, and fish oil for about a week prior to your treatment.

            description="Botox is a popular, non-surgical cosmetic treatment that uses a purified form of botulinum toxin to temporarily relax targeted facial muscles, reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It works by blocking nerve signals that cause muscles to contract, resulting in smoother, more youthful-looking skin. Commonly used to treat areas such as forehead lines, frown lines, and crowâ€™s feet, Botox is a quick, minimally invasive procedure with little to no downtime. In addition to its aesthetic benefits, Botox is also used for various medical purposes, including treating migraines, excessive sweating, and muscle spasms. The results typically become visible within a few days and can last for several months, making it a highly sought-after solution for both cosmetic enhancement and therapeutic relief. "
